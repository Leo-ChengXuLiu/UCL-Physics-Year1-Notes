## 📖 About These Notes
This is not just a summary of the slides. This is a complete reconstruction of the UCL Year 1 Physics curriculum, written with a focus on **first-principles derivation** and **comprehensive extension**.

### Why use these notes?
* **📐 Complete Derivations (全过程推导):**
    * Every single formula appearing in Lecture PPTs and Reading Assignments is derived from scratch.
    * No "magic steps" skipped. I bridge the gaps that professors often leave out.
* **🌌 Massive Extensions (超大量拓展):**
    * Contains supplementary knowledge and mathematical context that goes beyond the syllabus but is crucial for a deep understanding of physics.
* **✍️ Handwriting Aesthetics:**
    * Created in Notability. Designed to be visually structured for logical flow.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Progress (更新进度)
*Check back often to see new modules!*
> **📢 Quality Notice regarding Week 1-5:**
> Please note that **PHAS0004 (Weeks 1-5)** and **Math (Weeks 1-5)** are currently uploaded as **scanned paper notes**. The quality is not yet optimal. I am currently remastering them into the high-quality **digital handwritten format** (same standard as Week 6 & 7) and will upload the improved versions soon. Thanks for your patience!

These are my personal study notes. While I strive for rigor, they are unofficial. The "extensions" part may cover topics slightly outside the standard exam scope but are intended for enthusiasts.
